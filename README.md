# elementum-remake
A more experimental/refined version of an action puzzle platformer that started out as a game jam, then moved on to be a small 12-week uni project called Elementum.

Goals of this project:
- Refine the player character's movement
- Improve the game's art
- Introduce all elements
- Add more effects and juice
