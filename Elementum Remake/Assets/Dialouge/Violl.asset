  - You're here. You're finally here.
  - I've been searching for you for quite some time and i was beginning to lose hope
  - These parts have been untouched for years. Nature has relaimed it since the wars
    split the world.
  - But now that I've found you, we might finally have a chance to reconnect. Reforge
    the paths between our people.
  - You have ancient blood. Ancient mechanisms respond to ancient blood.
  - Go forth and make your own path, so that we may follow on day.
